Arctis Nova Pro GameDAC - EQ EnablerThis script solves a common issue for SteelSeries headset owners, allowing you to use the Engine's Equalizer (EQ) presets and the hardware ChatMix dial simultaneously.The SteelSeries GG software creates a conflict: when the Sonar suite is enabled for the headset, it takes over all audio processing and disables the standard Engine EQ. This script sends a direct command to the GameDAC to reactivate your saved Engine EQ profile, allowing you to use it together with the hardware ChatMix, without the Sonar software interfering.This script is written in Python and uses cross-platform libraries, but has only been thoroughly tested on Windows.FeaturesEnables the use of the Engine's EQ alongside the hardware ChatMix dial.Sends a single, targeted command to the GameDAC.Does not require administrator privileges to run.Works without the SteelSeries GG software running in the background (after the initial EQ setup).Can be compiled into a standalone .exe file for convenience.RequirementsPython 3.x: Download from python.orghidapi library: This will be installed automatically in the next steps.Headset: SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro with GameDAC.Finding Your Device IDs (If Necessary)This script uses VENDOR_ID = 0x1038 and PRODUCT_ID = 0x12CB, which are correct for the Arctis Nova Pro with GameDAC.
